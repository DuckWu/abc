After team discussion and evaluation of routing options for handling JSON files from multiple vendors, we have aligned on:

Option 2: Create a New Folder for incoming files from new vendors (e.g., SmartComm).

Rationale:

Minimizes risk to existing Broadridge pipeline

Allows isolated testing and controlled rollout for new vendors

Provides long-term flexibility as vendor-specific requirements evolve

Next Steps:

Sterling to configure new inbound and Logstash input folders

Logstash team to add support for new folder in pipeline

Kibana team to update dashboards to include new vendor field

End-to-end testing before production rollout

This decision ensures safe onboarding of additional vendors while maintaining the integrity of current processes.
