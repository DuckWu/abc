1. JSON File Naming Convention Change
Category	Description
Previous File Naming	bsc_brcc_php_interactive_cp_letter_print_MMDDCCYYHHMMSSsss_001.<env>.json
Updated File Naming	bsc_<tbd>_php_interactive_cp_letter_print_MMDDCCYYHHMMSSsss_001.<env>.json
Change Summary	The hardcoded vendor designation (brcc) in the filename is replaced with a dynamic vendor value.
Routing Impact	No routing changes are required. Logstash continues to ingest JSON files without modification.
Vendor Identification	Vendor name will be extracted from the filename using Logstash processing (e.g., grok pattern match).
2. Dashboard Requirements
New Dashboards
Requirement	Description
Dashboard Creation	Dashboards will be created as described in the attached documentation once data is available.
Content Guidelines	Must follow rules around section ordering, product-type fields, and event capture formatting.
Cleanup Tasks	Remove placeholder text: "New Dashboard Development Requirements".
Existing Dashboards (Kibana)
Dashboard Area	Change Summary
Broadridge Field Update	The existing "Broadridge" field in dashboards will be renamed to "Broadridge Mailed".
Addition of New Vendor Field	A new field <Vendor Name> Mailed will be added to support counts per new vendor.
Vendor Dashboards	Update filters and aggregations to incorporate the new vendor field.
Cleanup Tasks	Remove placeholder text: "Existing Dashboard Changes".
3. Acceptance Criteria
Criteria	Expected Outcome
Vendor has created compliant #3 JSON	JSON files follow the new naming convention and field structure.
JSON files are successfully ingested by Logstash	Vendor name is extracted correctly from filename during ingestion.
Metadata fields appear correctly in dashboards	"Broadridge Mailed" and <Vendor Name> Mailed data is captured and visualized appropriately.
Routing remains unchanged	No disruption or modification required in routing or Logstash ingestion pipelines.
